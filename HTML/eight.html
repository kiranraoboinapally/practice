        <style>
            /* Internal CSS: Styles applied to h2, h3, and p elements */
            h2, h3, p {
                color: rgb(0, 255, 255); /* Cyan color for these elements */

        <!--
        Advantages of Inline CSS:
        1. Can apply styles to a specific element without affecting others.
        2. Quick for testing small changes or overrides.
        
        Disadvantages of Inline CSS:
        1. Not reusable across multiple elements or pages.
        2. Makes HTML code cluttered and harder to maintain.
        3. Overrides external and internal styles, making the code less consistent.

        <!-- Internal CSS: Styles applied to these elements from <style> in <head> -->
        <h2>Internal Css</h2>
        <h3>Internal Css</h3>
        
        <!--
        Advantages of Internal CSS:
        1. Good for styling a single document without external dependencies.
        2. Keeps styling close to the HTML content, easy to manage for smaller projects.
        
        Disadvantages of Internal CSS:
        1. Can increase page size by adding CSS rules within the HTML file.
        2. Not reusable across multiple pages unless copied into each page.
        3. Can lead to conflicts if the same elements are styled differently across different pages.

        <!-- External CSS: External file 'first.css' is used, but not shown here -->
        <h4>External Css</h4>
        <!--
        Advantages of External CSS:
        1. Can be reused across multiple HTML files, making the website easier to maintain.
        2. Reduces the size of the HTML files by separating styles.
        3. CSS rules can be cached by the browser, improving page load times.
        
        Disadvantages of External CSS:
        1. Requires an additional HTTP request to load the CSS file (can impact performance).
        2. More complex to manage for smaller websites.
        3. Dependency on external files, meaning a broken or missing CSS file could affect the website's appearance.
